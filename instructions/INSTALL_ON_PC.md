# install on pc

Here is an english laguage guide to use rime on a pc (using the zhengma input method as an example):
https://wiki.michaelhan.net/Hanja_IME

After RIME has been installed, the guide shows how to install input methods using the command line. An easier way
is to copy-paste the .yaml files into the RIME holder. Here is how to do it:

1: follow the Hanja_IME guide until you can see the RIME ime when you hold down Win and press space:

Rime should show up. If it doesnt, try to restart the computer:

2: Then go to the path: C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Rime
and paste the Liumafan and/or Liumajian .yaml files to the folder (marked in red).

3: Then open the "default" file (marked in blue above) and add the Liumafan and/or Liumajian to the file like this:
(if you prefer, you could instead replace the default file with this file: \rime-liuma\yamlFiles\default.custom.yaml)

4: Close the window and select RIME as the input method by pressing Win + space. Then right-click on the 中 symbol.

5: you should then get a window like this. Now left-click on the text 重新部署. 
Then the changes you made should take effect: 

<img src="../images\pc\reload.jpg" width="300" height="150">

6: You shoul now be able to select 劉碼繁 Liumafan or 刘码简 Liumajian by pressing F4 and then press Enter. 
Liumafan and Liumajian doesnt show up among the options, you might need to restart the pc and press F4 again:

7: Now you should be able to write:

<img src="../images\pc\uod.jpg" width="900" height="400">

you can shift back to english by either pressing Win + Space or by pressing Shift.
